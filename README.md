## About The Project

Very interesting project to learn how to process API data and mix it with different techniques to get the optimal result for display.

## Built with

- React
- TailwindCSS
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Flexbox / Grid

## What I learned

I learned to work with React using TypeScript and all the benefits that become with it. First of all, using types and interfaces makes you work data more secure and provides a better comprehension of the code and its content. 
On the other hand, I found very useful the error messages constantly indicating you what and why problem is occuring.
Finally, TypeScript with React results very easygoing and satisfying making an app.
